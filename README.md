Algorithms is an API for common search and sort algorithms.  The package would aim to be:

- **Universal** Serve as a one-stop library for implementation of common search and sort algorithms both in competitive programming, competitive data science and production
- **Lightweight** Have the minimal possible dependencies, which makes it super easy and lightweight to use
- **Intuitive** Use the API without worrying about the naming convention, and make the package very less documentation dependent.



Documentation is WIP.
